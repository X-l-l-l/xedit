# Xedit
A simple TUI (Terminal User Interface) text editor written in python using the textual module.
By running the script with the path of a file, the terminal will turn into a text editor with minimal functionalities, at the moment.
I plan on adding more functionalities like syntaxing .py, .c, .c++ and other code related files with some user freindly efficient functionalities like auto closing brackets, auto indentation and others.
